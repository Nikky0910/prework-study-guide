        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>To declare a variable, you use the "let", "var" or "const" keywords, followed by the name of the variable and a semicolon to end the statement.</li>
          <li>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value or you can do both operations at the same time.</li>
          <li>You retrieve the variable's value by calling the variable's name (f.e.: myVariable;).</li>
          <li>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in your code.</li>
          <li>Variables may hold different data types: strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and objects.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. Code runs from the first statement at the top of the page down to the last statement at the bottom of the page. The order of the code afects the outcome.</li>
          <li>Conditionals and loops can alter the control flow so that the code executes only if a certain condition is met</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement</li>
          <li>When using the "if" statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>To declare an "if" statement we start with the "if" keyword, followed by the condition between parentheses and the block of code to be executed if the condition is truthy within curly brackets.</li>
          <li>If we would like to provide more conditions, we use "else if".</li>
          <li>To store multiple data items in a variable, instead of just one, we would use an Array.</li>
          <li>An Array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>An array is especially useful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once. Arrays can store different types of data, are zero-indexed and sequential.</li>
          <li>To create an array we declare a variable equal to multiple data items whithin square brackets, separated by a comma.</li>
          <li>To access an individual data item inside the array, we must have the location of the data item or index.</li>
          <li>Each data item is assigned an index according to the order in which is stored in the array.</li>
          <li>The indices or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>To access an individual item of the array, we start with the name of the variable that stores the array, followed by the corresponding index of that item in square brackets.</li>
          <li>To log the values stored in the array in an automated way, instead of doing it manually, we use loops.</li>
          <li>A "for" loop uses a predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in the array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>To use a "for" loop, we need the data item's index and the array's length, necessary for the loop to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array.</li>
          <li>To declare the variable in a "for" loop we use the "let" keyword, as it allows us reassing the value of a variable over time and store changing values.</li>
          <li>A "for" loop contains 3 important statements: the starting point for our loop (we declare a variable x, equal to the index number were we want our loop to start-zero by default); the condition (as long as the number in the variable is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running- x has to be minor than arrayName.length); the predictable pattern of the index, which increases by one each time. (x++) </li>
          <li>To declare a "for" loop, we start with the "for" keyword, followed by the 3 statements between parentheses and separated by semicolons, along with the action we want to be executed for each loop inside curly brackets.</li>
          <li>On the contrary of a "for" loop or a conditional statement, functions do not automatically execute when a Js file is run. Instead, they must be called by name.</li>
          <li>A function's name is always followed by a parentheses</li>
          <li>There are 2 requirements for a Js function: you have to declare it first and after, you have to call it.</li>
          <li>To define a function you must start with the "function" keyword, followed by the function's name and a parentheses, along with the action we want to be executed inside curly brackets.</li>
